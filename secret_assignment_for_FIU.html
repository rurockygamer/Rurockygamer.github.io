		<div class="container">
			<ol>
				<li class="items">Explain why you chose this profession and how it aligns with your life goals. </li>
				<p class="answer">As it is evident by the format that I chose to use as the “presentation,” I chose web developer. This aligns to my initial
				<br>ideas because I like creating websites and I have over 100 hours of experience.
				</p>

				<li class="items">What would the work environment, or surroundings, be like? </li>
				<p class="answer">Stressful in the majority. Web developing deals with major yet simple errors; such errors are major because they are nerve
				<br> wracking to solve, but the solution is (most of the time) as simple as a semicolon. 
				<br>
				<br> Or that is what I thought...
				<br>
				<br>The work environment for web developers can be very diverse. They may work in an office, or they may work remotely. They may 
				<br>work for a company, or they may work for themselves. No matter what the work environment is like, web developers need to have 
				<br>a good understanding of computers and the internet. They should be able to use various programming languages, and they should 
				<br>be able to work with different types of software.
				</p>

				<li class="items">What is the growth or job outlook for your profession? </li>
				<p class="answer">I plan to use this as my base, and then expand onto something else.
				<br>The growth in web developing is largely due to the fact that the internet has become an essential part of our lives. We use
				<br>it for everything from communication to entertainment and shopping. This has created a demand for skilled web developers who 
				<br>can create websites that are both functional and attractive.
				<br>The number of people who are using the internet is growing every day, which means that there is a growing market for web
				<br>developers. In order to meet this demand, more and more people are learning how to develop websites.
				<br>There are a number of reasons why someone might want to learn how to develop websites. Maybe they have a great idea for a 
				<br>website and they want to turn it into a reality. Or maybe they want to start their own web development business.
				<br>Whatever the reason, the growth in web developing is sure to continue.
				</p> 

				<li class="items">What kind of technology is needed or used for this career? </li>
				<p class="answer">There is a lot of technology required in web developing. This includes things like programming languages, web servers, and
				<br>databases. Programming languages are used to create the website's code. Web servers are used to host the website. Databases
				<br>are used to store information for the website.
				</p>

				<li class="items">What changes in technology are projected in this field? </li>
				<p class="answer">I have seen evidence of fractal computers, and the use of quantum computers as an online service.
					<br>New technologies in web developing have allowed for more interactive and engaging websites. These new technologies
					<br>include HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. With these new technologies, website developers are able to create websites that are
					<br>more responsive to user input and provide a more immersive experience. Additionally, these new technologies allow for more
					<br>complex animations and interactions.
				</p>

				<li class="items">How can your major help you prepare for this profession? </li>
				<p class="answer">Well, I can solve many problems per minute, and that is a strong part of the job.</p> 

				<li class="items">What did you learn about your chosen profession that you didn’t know before? </li>
				<p class="answer">I recently learned that even if you are right and the code is right, I might fail because of user use.

				</p>

				<li class="items">Where could you gain experience at FIU and within the community? </li>
				<p class="answer">I know that in the computer built-space I can learn from experts in the field.
				</p>


				<li class="items">Highlight three major differences and 3 similarities between Handshake and LinkedIn. How can these benefit you as a student
				<br> looking for a job or internship? 
				<br> Remember: your presentation does not need to be a PowerPoint, you can choose to record a video, make a Prezi presentation, 
				<br> or get creative with other media tools!</li>
				<ol class="answer">I have found that Handshake and LinkedIn have some major yet partially hidden differences. 
					<li>While LinkedIn is public, handshake requires a license for universities and other institutions I believe. </li>
					<li>LinkedIn is more complete for creating a resume, while Handshake is better for getting job and internship opportunities. </li>
					<li>LinkedIn Learning works better than Handshake training. </li>
