		<h1>Career Project: Presentation</h1>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Explain why you chose this profession and how it aligns with your life goals. </li>
				<p>As it is evident by the format that I chose to use as the “presentation,” I chose web developer. This aligns to my initial
				<br>ideas because I like creating websites and I have over 100 hours of experience.</p>

				<li>What would the work environment, or surroundings, be like? </li>
				<p>Stressful in the majority. Web developing deals with major yet simple errors; such errors are major because they are nerve
				<br> wracking to solve, but the solution is (most of the time) as simple as a semicolon.</p>

				<li>What is the growth or job outlook for your profession? </li>
				<p>I plan to use this as my base, and then expand onto something else.</p> 

				<li>What kind of technology is needed or used for this career? </li>
				<p>A powerful laptop is enough, but for the professional level one would deal with servers and massive computer rooms.</p>

				<li>What changes in technology are projected in this field? </li>
				<p>I have seen evidence of fractal computers, and the use of quantum computers as an online service.</p>

				<li>How can your major help you prepare for this profession? </li>
				<p>Well, I can solve many problems per minute, and that is a strong part of the job.</p> 

				<li>What did you learn about your chosen profession that you didn’t know before? </li>
				<p>I recently learned that even if you are right and the code is right, I might fail because of user use.</p>

				<li>Where could you gain experience at FIU and within the community? </li>
				<p>I know that in the computer built-space I can learn from experts in the field.</p>

				<li>Highlight three major differences and 3 similarities between Handshake and LinkedIn. How can these benefit you as a student
				<br> looking for a job or internship? 
				<br> Remember: your presentation does not need to be a PowerPoint, you can choose to record a video, make a Prezi presentation, 
				<br> or get creative with other media tools!</li>
				<ol>I have found that Handshake and LinkedIn have some major yet partially hidden differences. 
					<li>While LinkedIn is public, handshake requires a license for universities and other institutions I believe. </li>
					<li>LinkedIn is more complete for creating a resume, while Handshake is better for getting job and internship opportunities. </li>
					<li>LinkedIn Learning works better than Handshake training. </li>

				</ol>
